its also important but im willing to have less of it to accommodate your need for firewood how about this i take 2 water and 1 food, and you take 2 firewood and 1 food we both get 1 food, and we each get more of what we prefer does this sound fair to you <eos>\n", "Bob   : i understand your preference for water however, could you clarify how much water you would need to meet your needs would you be able to manage with just 1 water instead of 2 <eos>\n", "Alice : i see your point i can manage with 1 water, 1 firewood, and 1 food this way, you can have 2 firewood, 1 water, and 1 food we both

preference for firewood my main preference is for water however, im willing to take 1 firewood to ensure we both get an equal number of items i believe this distribution is fair and considers both our
